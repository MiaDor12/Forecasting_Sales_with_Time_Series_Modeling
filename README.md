# Forecasting Sales with Times Series Modeling
* The notebook contains an analysis and modeling of the "Rossmann Store Sales" dataset from kaggle: www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales.
* The goal of the competition is to train a model that predicts future sales of six weeks in advance, with the lowest Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE).
* This is a two-day project I did with two of my teammates, [Amit Sarid](https://github.com/amitsarid) and [Ido Berlin](https://github.com/IdoBerlin).
* The purpose of this project for us was to experiment with time-series data and with the Facebook Prophet tool.
* The prediction that we submitted to kaggle got RMSPE score of 0.13223, which is really high compared to other competitors.
